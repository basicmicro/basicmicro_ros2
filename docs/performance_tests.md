# Performance Tests Guide

The performance test suite validates system performance characteristics under real-world robotics workloads. These tests measure and benchmark buffer performance, command latency, throughput, and real-time constraints with actual hardware.

## Overview

**Purpose**: Measure and validate system performance characteristics
- **Buffer Performance**: Command queuing and execution efficiency
- **Command Latency**: Time from ROS2 command to motor response
- **Throughput Validation**: High-frequency command processing
- **Real-time Constraints**: Timing requirement verification
- **Requirements**: Physical Basicmicro controller and ROS2 environment

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements
```bash
# Recommended hardware for performance testing
- USB Roboclaw 2x15a or higher (adequate performance characteristics)
- Encoders connected for position/velocity feedback
- Motors with sufficient load for realistic testing
- USB 2.0 or higher connection for adequate throughput
```

### Software Prerequisites
```bash
# ROS2 environment (required for Node-based performance tests)
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash

# Build and source workspace
cd /path/to/workspace
colcon build --packages-select basicmicro_driver
source install/setup.bash

# Performance test dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-benchmark
```

### ROS2 Initialization Fix
**Critical**: Performance tests require proper ROS2 initialization for Node-based classes:
```bash
# Performance tests need ROS2 environment sourced
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash

# Tests automatically initialize ROS2 if not already initialized
# This fixes the "rclpy.init() has not been called" error
```

## Running Performance Tests

### Basic Performance Test Execution
```bash
# Run all performance tests (requires hardware and ROS2)
python3 -m pytest test/performance/ --hardware --hardware-port=/dev/ttyACM1 -v

# With specific controller settings
python3 -m pytest test/performance/ --hardware --hardware-port=/dev/ttyACM1 --hardware-baud=38400 --hardware-address=128 -v

# With benchmarking output
python3 -m pytest test/performance/ --hardware --hardware-port=/dev/ttyACM1 -v --benchmark-only
```

### Focused Performance Testing
```bash
# Test specific performance category
python3 -m pytest test/performance/test_buffer_performance.py --hardware --hardware-port=/dev/ttyACM1 -v
python3 -m pytest test/performance/test_command_latency.py --hardware --hardware-port=/dev/ttyACM1 -v

# Test with performance metrics output
python3 -m pytest test/performance/ --hardware --hardware-port=/dev/ttyACM1 -v --tb=short --durations=10
```

    for i, speed in enumerate(commands):
        # Record state before command
        initial_encoders = self.controller.GetEncoders(self.address)
        
        # Send buffered command
        result = self.controller.SpeedM1M2(self.address, speed, speed)
        assert result, f"Command {i+1} failed"
        
        # Check buffer status
        buffer_status = self.controller.ReadBuffers(self.address)
        if buffer_status[0]:
            utilization = (buffer_status[1] / 32) * 100
            assert utilization < 80, f"Buffer utilization too high: {utilization}%"
        
        # Validate motor response
        time.sleep(0.1)
        final_encoders = self.controller.GetEncoders(self.address)
        movement_detected = abs(final_encoders[1] - initial_encoders[1]) > 10

        # Send command
        result = self.controller.SpeedM1M2(self.address, 1000, 1000)
        if result:
            command_count += 1
        
        # Brief delay for sustainable testing
        time.sleep(0.01)  # 100Hz attempt rate
    
    actual_duration = time.perf_counter() - start_time
    command_frequency = command_count / actual_duration
    
    # Performance validation
    assert command_frequency >= 80, f"Command frequency too low: {command_frequency:.1f} Hz"
    assert command_frequency <= 120, f"Command frequency unrealistic: {command_frequency:.1f} Hz"

        jitter = abs(actual_completion - expected_completion)
        jitter_measurements.append(jitter)
        
        # Wait for next interval
        next_target = (i + 1) * 0.01

## Troubleshooting Performance Tests

### Common Performance Issues

#### **ROS2 Initialization Error**
```bash
# Error: rclpy.init() has not been called. msg:cannot create node
# This occurs when BufferManager (Node-based class) cannot initialize

# Solution: Ensure ROS2 environment sourced
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash

# The test framework automatically handles ROS2 initialization
# but requires proper environment setup
```

#### **Hardware Performance Issues**
```bash
# Buffer utilization too high (>80%)
# Causes: Hardware not keeping up with commands

# Solutions:
# 1. Reduce command frequency
# 2. Check motor load and current limits
# 3. Verify PID settings in Motion Studio
# 4. Check USB connection quality

# Command latency too high (>50ms)
# Causes: Communication or hardware processing delays

# Solutions:
# 1. Check USB cable and connection
# 2. Verify baud rate settings (38400 vs 115200)
# 3. Reduce motor load for testing
# 4. Check system CPU load during tests
```

#### **Test Environment Issues**
```bash
# Inconsistent performance results
# Causes: Variable system load, hardware state

# Solutions:
# 1. Run tests on dedicated test machine
# 2. Ensure consistent hardware state
# 3. Allow warm-up time before measurement
# 4. Run multiple test iterations for averaging
```

### Performance Optimization

#### **Buffer Performance Optimization**
```python
# Optimize buffer usage patterns
def optimize_buffer_usage(self):
    # Monitor buffer status before sending commands
    buffer_status = self.controller.ReadBuffers(self.address)
    if buffer_status[0]:
        utilization = (buffer_status[1] / 32) * 100
        if utilization > 70:  # Warning threshold
            # Wait for buffer to drain
            time.sleep(0.01)
    
    # Send command only when buffer available
    result = self.controller.SpeedM1M2(self.address, speed, speed)
    return result
```

#### **Latency Optimization**
```python
# Minimize command latency
def minimize_command_latency(self):
    # Use fastest command types for time-critical operations
    # Duty cycle commands are typically fastest
    result = self.controller.DutyM1M2(self.address, duty1, duty2)
    
    # Emergency stop uses fastest possible path
    emergency_result = self.controller.DutyM1M2(self.address, 0, 0)
    
    return result
```

The performance test suite provides comprehensive validation that the ROS2 Basicmicro driver meets real-world robotics performance requirements for buffer management, command latency, throughput, and real-time operation.
